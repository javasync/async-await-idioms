## JavaScript sample looking concurrency in fetchAndSum()

Install with: `npm install` and run `node app`.

Comparing the use of `foreach` loop **without** lambdas and the use of a
collection pipeline (such as `....map(...).reduce(...)`) **with** lambdas
and the resulting 
_sequential_ versus _concurrent_ behavior.
